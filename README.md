Detecting densely packed and multi-sized objects, such as Waste
electronic components on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)
currently is a significant problem in computer vision due to the
high intra-class variance and low inter-class variance among
components particularly on PCB boards. This paper explores
state-of-the-art object detection frameworks, including YOLOv5,
YOLOv8, and YOLOv10, to address these challenges. We evaluate
the performance of these architectures on various PCB datasets,
aiming to enhance detection accuracy in environments
characterized by dense, multi-shaped, and multi-sized objects.
The primary objective of the paper is to explore and enhance
object detection techniques, specifically focusing on the detection
of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) components. The paper aims to
increase the performance and accuracy of object detection models
for dense and multi-sized PCB components, addressing the
challenges posed by varying shapes and sizes of these
components. Overall, the objective is to advance the state of the
art in object detection for PCB components by addressing these
specific challenges and improving model performance.
